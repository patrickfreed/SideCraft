Sidecraft
=========

Sidecraft is my 2d implementation of block based sandbox games in Java. 
Right now (and for the last couple years), it is in early development. 
This is mainly a project that I am doing to teach myself more about game 
design and programming, so a "finished product" may never be released. If I
do finish this, I plan to licence it under GPL.
